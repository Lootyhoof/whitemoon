# White Moon
![Preview](http://i67.tinypic.com/jh4gba.png)

Fork of the theme [Simple White](https://github.com/louischan/simplewhite) by Louis Chan for Pale Moon with elements ported from [Simple White X](https://github.com/johngraciliano/simplewhite).

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

On Unix systems (or Windows 10, with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) you can optionally run `build.sh` instead. Running this as-is will produce a .xpi file ending in `-dev`, and if run from the command line and appending a number (e.g. `./build.sh 2`) will append that number to the filename instead.

## Download
You can grab the latest release either from the Releases section of this repository, or the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/white-moon/).
